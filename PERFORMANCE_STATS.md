## Features

### ğŸ“Š Performance Tracking
- **Overall Statistics**: Total questions answered, accuracy percentage, current streak, and average time per question
- **Difficulty Breakdown**: Performance across easy, intermediate, and hard questions
- **Question Type Analysis**: Detailed stats for each question type (Quantitative, Verbal, Data Insights, Logical Reasoning, Reading Comprehension, Logic Games)
- **Recent Activity**: Daily performance tracking with visual indicators

### ğŸ§  Smart Insights
- **Strengths Identification**: Automatically detects your best-performing areas
- **Improvement Areas**: Highlights topics that need more practice
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests specific study strategies based on your performance patterns

### ğŸ“ˆ Visual Progress Tracking
- Color-coded performance indicators
- Accuracy trends over time
- Streak tracking for motivation
- Performance comparisons across different categories

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Data Collection
Every time you answer a question (whether through Test Alarm or real alarms), the system automatically records:
- Your answer and whether it was correct
- Time taken to answer
- Question difficulty and type
- Source (test mode vs. alarm mode)

### 2. Real-time Analysis
The system continuously analyzes your performance to provide:
- Updated accuracy percentages
- Streak calculations
- Performance trends
- Intelligent insights

### 3. Local Storage
All performance data is stored locally on your device using localStorage, ensuring:
- Privacy (your data never leaves your device)
- Fast access and updates
- No need for user accounts or internet connectivity for stats

## Using the Stats Page

### Accessing Your Stats
1. Navigate to the Stats tab in the bottom navigation
2. View your comprehensive performance dashboard
3. Explore different sections for detailed insights

### Understanding Your Data

#### Overall Performance Section
- **Questions**: Total number of questions you've answered
- **Accuracy**: Your overall success rate
- **Current Streak**: Number of consecutive correct answers
- **Avg Time**: Average time per question in seconds

#### Difficulty Performance
- **Easy**: Green indicator - foundational concepts
- **Intermediate**: Yellow indicator - moderate complexity
- **Hard**: Red indicator - advanced problem-solving

#### Question Type Performance
Shows your accuracy for each type of question:
- **GMAT**: Quantitative, Verbal, Data Insights
- **LSAT**: Logical Reasoning, Reading Comprehension, Logic Games

#### Performance Insights
- **Strengths** ğŸ’ª: Areas where you excel (>80% accuracy)
- **Improvements** ğŸ“ˆ: Areas needing attention (<60% accuracy)
- **Recommendations** ğŸ’¡: Specific study suggestions

#### Recent Activity
- Daily performance overview
- Color-coded accuracy indicators
- Last 7 days of activity

### Managing Your Data

#### Reset Data
- Use the "Reset Data" button to clear all performance statistics
- This action cannot be undone
- Useful for starting fresh or cleaning up test data

## For Developers

### Technical Implementation

#### UserStatsService
The `userStatsService` handles all statistics tracking:

```typescript
// Record a question attempt
userStatsService.recordQuestionAttempt({
  questionId: number,
  userAnswer: string,
  isCorrect: boolean,
  timeSpent: number,
  source: 'alarm' | 'test' | 'practice',
  questionType: string,
  difficulty: string,
  exam: string
});

// Get current statistics
const stats = userStatsService.getUserStats();

// Get performance insights
const insights = userStatsService.getPerformanceInsights();
```

#### Integration Points
- **AlarmScreen.tsx**: Records attempts when questions are answered
- **Stats Page**: Displays comprehensive performance data
- **localStorage**: Persistent storage for user data

#### Testing
For development testing, use the browser console:

```javascript
// Add sample data
window.userStatsService.populateSampleData();

// View current stats
console.log(window.userStatsService.getUserStats());

// Get insights
console.log(window.userStatsService.getPerformanceInsights());

// Reset data
window.userStatsService.resetUserData();
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Charts and Graphs**: Visual representation of progress over time
- **Goal Setting**: Set accuracy targets and track progress
- **Study Recommendations**: AI-powered study plan suggestions
- **Export Data**: Download performance data as CSV/JSON
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud storage for cross-device access

### Migration to Backend
The current localStorage-based system can be migrated to use the Prisma/PostgreSQL backend for:
- Cross-device synchronization
- User accounts and authentication
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Social features (leaderboards, sharing progress)

## Privacy and Data

### Local Storage Only
- All performance data is stored locally on your device
- No data is sent to external servers
- Complete privacy and control over your information

### Data Structure
The system stores:
- Question attempt records
- Calculated statistics
- Performance trends
- No personally identifiable information beyond your answers

## Troubleshooting

### Stats Not Updating
- Ensure you're answering questions through the app (Test Alarm or real alarms)
- Check browser console for any error messages
- Try refreshing the stats page

### Missing Data
- Performance data is tied to your specific browser and device
- Clearing browser data will remove your stats
- Use different browsers or devices will show different stats

### Reset Issues
If you need to completely reset:
1. Use the "Reset Data" button in the stats page
2. Or manually clear localStorage in browser developer tools
3. Refresh the page to see empty stats

## Support

For issues or questions about the performance stats feature:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that JavaScript and localStorage are enabled
3. Ensure you're using a modern browser
4. Test with the sample data function for debugging

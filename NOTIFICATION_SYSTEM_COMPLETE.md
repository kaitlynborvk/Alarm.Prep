# üö® AlarmPrep Notification System - Implementation Complete! 

## ‚úÖ What We've Built

The AlarmPrep app now has a fully functional alarm/notification system that:

1. **Schedules Alarms**: Users can create alarms with specific times, days, exam types, and difficulty levels
2. **Triggers Notifications**: iOS notifications fire at the scheduled time, even when the app is in background
3. **Shows Quiz Modal**: When notification is tapped, a full-screen quiz appears
4. **Requires Correct Answer**: User must answer correctly to dismiss the alarm
5. **Supports Snooze**: Option to snooze alarm for 5 minutes if needed
6. **Provides Haptic Feedback**: Device vibrates for correct/incorrect answers
7. **Persists Alarms**: Alarms survive app restarts and are stored locally

## üîß How It Works

### Alarm Creation Flow
1. User taps "+" button on home screen
2. Selects exam type (GMAT/LSAT), question type, difficulty, time, and days
3. Alarm is created using `alarmService.createAlarm()`
4. iOS notifications are scheduled for the next 30 days
5. Alarm appears in the user's alarm list

### Notification Trigger Flow
1. iOS fires the scheduled notification at the set time
2. User taps the notification (app opens if backgrounded)
3. `alarmService` receives the notification event
4. A random question is selected based on alarm criteria
5. `AlarmScreen` component appears as a full-screen modal
6. User must answer the question correctly to dismiss

### Answer Validation Flow
1. User selects an answer and taps "Submit Answer"
2. Answer is validated against the correct answer
3. **Correct Answer**: Success message, haptic feedback, alarm dismissed
4. **Incorrect Answer**: Error message, explanation shown, alarm continues
5. **Snooze**: Reschedules alarm for 5 minutes later

## üì± Testing the System

### Web Testing (Development)
```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Open localhost:3004 in browser
# Click "Test Modal" to see AlarmScreen immediately
# Click "Test Notification" to schedule a 10-second notification
```

### iOS Testing (Device)
```bash
# Build and sync for iOS
npm run ios:build

# Open in Xcode
npm run ios:open

# Run on device, then:
# 1. Allow notification permissions when prompted
# 2. Create an alarm for 2-3 minutes in the future
# 3. Put app in background or lock phone
# 4. Wait for notification to appear
# 5. Tap notification to open alarm screen
```

### Quick Test Script
```bash
# Use the test script for guided testing
./scripts/test-notifications.sh
```

## üìÇ Files Modified/Created

### Core Implementation
- `src/services/alarmService.ts` - Main alarm logic and notification handling
- `src/components/AlarmScreen.tsx` - Full-screen alarm/quiz modal
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Integration with main app flow

### Supporting Files
- `NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- `scripts/test-notifications.sh` - Test script for easy verification
- Package dependencies for Capacitor notifications and haptics

## üöÄ How to Deploy

### For Testing
1. Use the web version for UI/UX testing
2. Build iOS version for notification testing
3. Test on real iOS device (simulator has limitations)

### For Production
1. Remove test buttons from UI
2. Test thoroughly on multiple iOS versions
3. Ensure App Store privacy policy includes notification usage
4. Add user onboarding for notification permissions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing
- Check iOS Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí AlarmPrep
- Ensure notification permissions are granted
- Test with short-duration alarms (1-2 minutes)
- Verify app has background refresh enabled

### AlarmScreen Not Showing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify event listeners are set up
- Test with "Test Modal" button first
- Ensure `alarmService.initialize()` was called

### Questions Not Loading
- Check database connection
- Verify offline questions are available
- Test `dataService.getQuestions()` independently

## üéâ Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready for Production)
- [ ] Remove test buttons from UI
- [ ] Add user onboarding for notifications
- [ ] Test on multiple iOS devices/versions
- [ ] Add error boundary for crash protection

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Custom alarm sounds/ringtones
- [ ] Customizable snooze duration
- [ ] Alarm usage analytics
- [ ] Multiple alarms with different question types
- [ ] Progressive difficulty based on performance

## üìñ User Guide

For end users, the notification system works like this:
